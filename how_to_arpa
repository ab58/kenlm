Hi, can anyone tell me how to actually generate an ARPA file from a training file? There are no clear instructions on exactly how to do this.
That "bin/lmplz" thing doesn't work at all. I tried typing that into my iPython shell and it didn't work, I also tried that in my Cygwin and
it didn't work. I know how to use the example.py file, but that file calls on a pre-made ARPA file. What I need is to make an ARPA file from
my own text file I'm using for training. There are no clear instructions on how to do this and it's very frustrating. It also says "after 
compiling with bjam, run this command".I have no idea what "bjam" is and you don't explain this at all. Am I supposed to look up what these things 
are and learn how touse them, and then come back to this to try to use it? That could take several hours or days and I don't have that kind
of time. Also most of what's in the README is gibberish that I can't understand, and very little is explained about the technical terms you 
use in the README. I read them over and over and nothing makes sense to me. I managed to get the example script working but it only works
with the one ARPA file you provide which is useless becuase I need a way to generate my own ARPA. What is the way to do this, and is the 
explanation for how to generate the ARPA contained in the README? If it is, please point me to this. If it's the gibberish language that 
explains it, you need to explain exactly what all those terms mean and contextualize them, because I've gone through the README several 
times and very little of it makes sense to me.
